            <p>I will keep it plain, simple, and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I create this website when there are hundreds of topper blogs in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the answer is just in the question itself.</p>
<p class="p-4 bg-green-100 text-green-700">I created this website <strong>BECAUSE there are hundreds of websites which makes it even more confusing for aspirants to get started</strong>. I want to create a single &quot;HOW TO&quot; guide on UPSC. You read it once, and that's all! You won't have to ask &quot;how to crack UPSC&quot; to any topper ever again.</p>
<p>I will keep this website free, forever, and won't even place a single ad on it. That I promise.</p>
<p>I WON'T TRACK YOUR ACTIVITIES VIA ANY ANALYTICS APP AT ALL, EVER! That, too, I promise.</p>
